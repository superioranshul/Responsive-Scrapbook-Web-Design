Description:
The provided code consists of HTML and CSS for a travel website. The HTML document is structured using typical HTML tags like <html>, <head>, <body>, etc., and the content is divided into different sections using <div> tags, each representing a different part of the webpage. Inside these sections, there are various elements such as headings, paragraphs, buttons, images, and forms, which compose the layout and content of the webpage. Some elements have inline styles (e.g., style="..."), specifying their appearance directly within the HTML tags. The CSS code starts with a universal selector (*) to reset margin and padding for all elements to zero and sets the default font family and background color for the entire page. Each section of the webpage is styled separately using class selectors (e.g., .firstscreendiv, .secondscreendiv, etc.), and the CSS defines styles for headings (h1, h2, etc.), paragraphs (p), buttons, form elements, and images. The layout properties such as width, height, margin, padding, and positioning for different elements are specified, and additional styling is provided for specific elements like navigation items, customer testimonials, and footer links.
